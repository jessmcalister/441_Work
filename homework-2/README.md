<h1>Homework 2</h1>
<p>This week, I had a few challenges to overcome.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Changing my Atom code to connect to my 441 Work repo instead of my Intro to Web Design repo.
    <ul>
      <li>After a few days  trying to figure that out, I think I finally got it!</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Understanding where JS comes into play using HTML. It's a little bit of a learning curve because I haven't taken the Creative Coding course.</li>
  </ol>
